1. What is the data source?  Do you have permission to use the data?

The data source is Living Planet Database and I have permission to use the data since you must submit a reason for why you are downloading the data. I also have proper licensing in order to use the data appropriately.

2. What is the aim of this study?

The aim is to see the trend of breeding pairs among different wandering albatross colonies over time

3. What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study?

Question: Did the number of breeding pairs in 4 different colonies change between the years of 1990 - 2003?

4. Describe the key independent and dependent variable(s).

Independent: Year and Location
Dependent: Breeding pairs per location

5. What are the spatial and temporal structures to the data (number of sites, duration in years, etc.)?

Number of sites: 4
Duration in years: 13 

6. What is the overall sample size?

The data is taken from 4 locations, with 10 observations in total. The total amount of breeding pairs from all locations and for all 13 years is 10,142 pairs

7. Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.

I will use a linear regression model since it will be able to show me the rate of change (trend) and how much variation there is from the mean value of breeding pairs

8. Is there any other study information you would like to pre-register?

N/A
